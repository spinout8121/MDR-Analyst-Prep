### 1. **Malware Analysis**

1. How does malware typically bypass antivirus and endpoint protection systems?
    
    Malware bypasses antivirus (AV) and endpoint protection systems using several techniques, such as:
    
    - **Obfuscation**: Hiding malicious code in a way that AV signatures cannot detect.
    - **Polymorphism**: Changing the code every time it replicates.
    - **Packing**: Compressing the code to make it unreadable by AV.
    - **Fileless Malware**: Operating only in memory, leaving no trace on the disk.
    - **Disabling AV Software**: Advanced malware may disable antivirus software.
    - **Zero-Day Exploits**: Using vulnerabilities unknown to the vendor.

2. What steps would you take to perform a dynamic analysis of a potentially malicious file?
    
    Dynamic analysis involves executing the file in a controlled, isolated environment, such as a sandbox, to observe its behavior. Key steps include:
    
    - **Setting up a virtual environment** that mimics the target system.
    - **Executing the file** while monitoring its interactions with the system, such as file creation, registry modifications, network connections, and process activities.
    - **Capturing and analyzing network traffic** to identify any C2 communication.
    - **Using tools** like Process Monitor, Wireshark, and Sysinternals Suite to track the file’s behavior.
    - **Documenting the findings** to understand the file’s purpose and potential threat.
    
3. What are some common techniques used by malware to achieve persistence on a system?
    
    Common persistence techniques include:
    
    - **Registry modifications:** Adding entries in the Windows Registry (e.g., `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`) to run the malware at startup.
    - **Scheduled tasks:** Creating scheduled tasks to execute the malware at specific times or events.
    - **Service creation:** Installing the malware as a Windows service that starts automatically.
    - **Bootkits:** Infecting the master boot record (MBR) or UEFI to start before the OS loads.
    - **DLL hijacking:** Placing a malicious DLL in a directory where an application loads it instead of the legitimate one.
    - **Startup folder:** Dropping a shortcut or executable in the Windows Startup folder.

5. How does the use of encryption in malware complicate the analysis process?
    
    Encryption in malware complicates analysis because it obscures the code and data, making it difficult to determine the malware’s behavior or purpose. Analysts must first decrypt the content to understand its functionality, which often requires reverse engineering the encryption algorithm or obtaining the decryption key. Encryption can also hinder static analysis, as the code doesn’t reveal its true nature until it’s executed and decrypted in memory.
    
6. What are some common evasion techniques used by fileless malware?
    
    **Fileless malware** evades detection by not relying on traditional files. Instead, it operates directly in memory and uses legitimate system tools. Here are some common evasion techniques:
    
    1. [**PowerShell Exploitation**: Attackers use PowerShell scripts to execute malicious code directly in memory, avoiding the need to write files to disk](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/fileless-malware/).
    2. [**Registry-based Persistence**: Malicious code is stored in the Windows Registry, allowing it to persist without creating files on the hard drive](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/fileless-malware/).
    3. [**Memory Injection**: Injecting malicious code into the memory space of legitimate processes, making it harder to detect](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/fileless-malware/).

### 6. **Forensics and Memory Analysis**

1. What is the significance of memory analysis in malware investigations?
    
    Memory analysis is crucial because it allows investigators to examine the malware’s behavior in a live state, capturing volatile data such as running processes, open network connections, loaded modules, and active threads. This analysis can reveal hidden or injected code, encryption keys, and decrypted malicious payloads that would not be visible through static analysis alone. It also helps in detecting fileless malware, which resides only in memory.

    To conduct a forensic analysis of a compromised endpoint, follow these steps:
    
    - **Isolate the Endpoint**: Disconnect the device from the network to prevent further compromise.
    - **Preserve Evidence**: Create a bit-by-bit image of the system to ensure all data is preserved for analysis.
    - **Initial Assessment**: Perform a preliminary analysis to understand the scope and nature of the compromise.
    - **Collect Logs**: Gather system, application, and security logs for detailed examination.
    - **Analyze Malware**: If malware is detected, analyze it to understand its behavior and impact.
    - **Examine File System**: Look for unusual or unauthorized files, changes, and timestamps.
    - **Memory Analysis**: Analyze the system’s memory for signs of malicious activity.
    - **Network Analysis**: Review network traffic to identify any suspicious connections or data exfiltration.
    - **Identify Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**: Document any IOCs found during the analysis.
    - **Report Findings**: Compile a detailed report of your findings and provide recommendations for remediation.
    - **Remediation**: Work with IT and security teams to remove the threat and restore the system to a secure state.
    - **Post-Incident Review**: Conduct a review to identify lessons learned and improve future incident response.

3. What is the role of memory forensics in detecting and analyzing advanced threats?
    
    Memory forensics plays a crucial role in detecting and analyzing advanced threats by examining the volatile data in a system’s memory (RAM). Here’s how it helps:
    
    - **Identify Malware**: Detects malware that resides only in memory and doesn’t leave traces on the disk.
    - **Analyze Running Processes**: Examines active processes and their interactions to uncover suspicious activities.
    - **Extract Artifacts**: Retrieves important artifacts like encryption keys, passwords, and network connections.
    - **Detect Rootkits**: Identifies rootkits that hide their presence by manipulating system memory.

3. How do you analyze and mitigate threats in an environment with limited visibility, such as IoT devices?
4. How do you ensure that your malware analysis environment is secure and isolated?
    
    To ensure your malware analysis environment is secure and isolated, follow these steps:
    
    1. [**Use Virtual Machines (VMs)**: Set up your analysis environment in VMs to easily reset to a clean state after each analysis](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/building-a-custom-malware-analysis-lab-environment/).
    2. [**Isolate the Network**: Ensure the VM network is isolated from your main network. [Use an air-gapped network if internet access is needed](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/building-a-custom-malware-analysis-lab-environment/).
    3. [**Limit Internet Access**: Control and monitor any internet access to prevent malware from communicating with external entities](https://101.school/courses/introduction-to-malware-analysis/modules/3-environment-for-malware-analysis/units/1-safe-setup-guidelines).
    4. [**Disable Shared Folders**: Avoid using shared folders between the host and VM to prevent malware from spreading](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/building-a-custom-malware-analysis-lab-environment/).
    5. [**Use Snapshots**: Take snapshots of your VM before and after analysis to quickly revert to a clean state if needed](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/building-a-custom-malware-analysis-lab-environment/).
    6. [**Monitor System Activity**: Implement system monitoring tools to detect any unusual activity within the VM](https://101.school/courses/introduction-to-malware-analysis/modules/3-environment-for-malware-analysis/units/1-safe-setup-guidelines).
    7. [**Keep Software Updated**: Ensure all software, including the OS and analysis tools, are up-to-date to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities](https://101.school/courses/introduction-to-malware-analysis/modules/3-environment-for-malware-analysis/units/1-safe-setup-guidelines).
    8. [**Backup Data**: Regularly backup your data to recover quickly in case of any breaches](https://101.school/courses/introduction-to-malware-analysis/modules/3-environment-for-malware-analysis/units/1-safe-setup-guidelines).
